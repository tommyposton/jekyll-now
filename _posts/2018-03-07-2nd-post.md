In this lesson we sat down and signed in like normal. On spreadsheets we learnt how to add quantities to our totals, so we can add a number into a column and this will times the number of quantity by the price and add it to the total. I also started trying to input discounts into my work. I was quite surprised with the amount of variables that go into running even a very simple business.
