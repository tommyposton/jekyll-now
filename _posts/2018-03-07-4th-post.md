In this lesson we came in and sat down then signed in like usual. This lesson we had a cover as our teacher wasn't present. I spent the whole lesson trying to work out how to put in product codes and discounts. I also decided on a company name for my spreadsheets tommycorp. I tried my hardest and even worked with my fellow pupil kiran for around ten minutes but even our combined intellect could not sort the problem. In the end it wasnâ€™t a hugely successful lesson.
